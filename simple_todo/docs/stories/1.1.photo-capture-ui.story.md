# Story 1.1: Photo Capture UI Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user who takes multiple medications,
**I want** to photograph my medication labels using my device camera,
**so that** I can quickly capture medication information without typing everything manually.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can access camera functionality from the Add Medication screen
2. Camera interface displays a live video preview
3. User can capture a photo of medication label/bottle
4. Captured photo is processed locally to extract text information
5. Extracted information is displayed for user review and editing
6. User can accept or re-capture if photo quality is insufficient
7. Photo is deleted after information extraction for privacy
8. Camera functionality works on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create PhotoCapture component with camera interface (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Implement React Webcam integration for live preview
  - [x] Add capture button with visual feedback

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first implementation story for the project.

### Data Models
No specific data models are required for this UI-focused story. The extracted text will be structured as:
- medicationName: string
- dosage: string
- frequency: string (if extractable)
- instructions: string (if extractable)

[Source: PRD.md#functional-requirements FR2, FR3]

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required for this story. This is purely client-side functionality that will integrate with existing medication creation workflows.

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#api-architecture]

### Component Specifications
**PhotoCapture Component Location**: `/client/src/components/PhotoCapture/`
- **Main Component**: `PhotoCapture.js` - Primary camera interface
- **Sub-components**: 
  - `CameraPreview.js` - Live camera feed display
  - `CaptureControls.js` - Capture and control buttons
  - `OCRProcessor.js` - Text extraction logic
  - `ReviewInterface.js` - Edit extracted information

**Props Interface**:
```javascript
PhotoCapture.propTypes = {
  onMedicationExtracted: PropTypes.func.isRequired, // Callback with extracted data
  onCancel: PropTypes.func.isRequired, // Cancel photo capture
  isProcessing: PropTypes.bool, // External processing state
};
```

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#client-directory]

### File Locations
Based on project structure, create files in:
- `/client/src/components/PhotoCapture/` - Component files
- `/client/src/components/PhotoCapture/styles.css` - Component styles
- Integration point: `/client/src/pages/AddMedication.js` - Add PhotoCapture component

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#key-directories-explained]

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Framework**: React Testing Library with Jest (existing setup)
**Test File Location**: `/client/src/components/PhotoCapture/__tests__/`
**Specific Test Requirements**:
- Mock camera API calls using Jest mocks
- Test OCR processing with sample images
- Test component props and callback functions
- Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Test error handling for permission denied scenarios

**Testing Pattern**: Follow existing component testing patterns found in codebase

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

### Technical Constraints
**OCR Accuracy Requirement**: Minimum 85% success rate for clear, well-lit images
**Processing Time Limit**: OCR must complete within 10 seconds
**Privacy Requirement**: All images processed locally, deleted after extraction
**Browser Compatibility**: Must work in iOS Safari and Android Chrome
**Offline Capability**: Must function without internet connectivity

[Source: PRD.md#non-functional-requirements NFR1, NFR2, NFR6, NFR7, NFR9]

### Dependencies and Libraries
**React Webcam** (v7.2.0): Already configured for camera integration
**Tesseract.js** (v6.0.1): Already configured for OCR processing
**Integration**: Use existing api.js service pattern for consistent error handling

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#specialized-features]

### Testing

#### Test File Location
Place test files in `/client/src/components/PhotoCapture/__tests__/PhotoCapture.test.js`

#### Test Standards
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock external dependencies (camera API, Tesseract.js)
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Include accessibility testing (screen reader compatibility)

#### Testing Framework and Patterns
- **Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library (existing configuration)
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock camera getUserMedia API and Tesseract.js worker
- **Async Testing**: Use waitFor() for OCR processing completion

#### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test camera permission handling
- Verify image capture and OCR processing flow
- Test responsive design on mobile viewports
- Validate extracted data parsing and display
- Test privacy compliance (image deletion)
