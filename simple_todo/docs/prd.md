# Simple Medicine Logger Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable photo recognition for medication entry to reduce manual input friction
- Implement smart reminder system with adaptive learning based on user patterns  
- Add basic progress visualization showing medication adherence trends over time
- Provide export functionality for doctor visits and healthcare provider communication
- Maintain MVP simplicity while adding intelligent features that enhance user experience
- Validate user engagement with enhanced features before progressing to AI Medical Companion vision

### Background Context

The Simple Medicine Logger MVP has successfully proven the core concept of digital medication tracking with offline-first architecture. Based on the comprehensive brainstorming session and Project Brief, users need more than basic logging - they need intelligent assistance that reduces friction and provides meaningful insights into their medication adherence patterns.

Phase 2 addresses the immediate opportunities identified in the brainstorming: photo recognition for faster data entry, smart reminders that learn from user behavior, and progress visualization that motivates continued usage. These features bridge the gap between the proven MVP foundation and the long-term AI Medical Companion vision, while maintaining the application's core principle of simplicity and reliability.

## Requirements

### Functional

1. **FR1**: The system shall provide photo capture functionality that allows users to photograph pill bottles and medication labels for automatic data extraction
2. **FR2**: The system shall implement OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract medication name, dosage, and other relevant information from photographed labels
3. **FR3**: The system shall allow users to review and edit OCR-extracted information before saving to ensure accuracy
4. **FR4**: The system shall provide smart reminder functionality that learns from user medication-taking patterns and adapts reminder timing accordingly
5. **FR5**: The system shall track user response patterns to reminders (taken, dismissed, ignored) to improve future reminder effectiveness
6. **FR6**: The system shall provide flexible reminder windows that account for user lifestyle patterns rather than rigid scheduling
7. **FR7**: The system shall display basic progress visualization showing medication adherence trends over configurable time periods (daily, weekly, monthly)
8. **FR8**: The system shall calculate and display adherence percentages for individual medications and overall medication regimen
9. **FR9**: The system shall provide streak tracking to gamify consistent medication adherence
10. **FR10**: The system shall export medication history and adherence data in formats suitable for healthcare provider review (PDF, CSV)
11. **FR11**: The system shall allow users to generate concise medication summaries for doctor visits
12. **FR12**: The system shall maintain backward compatibility with all MVP functionality while adding Phase 2 features
13. **FR13**: The system shall provide user onboarding for new photo recognition and smart reminder features

### Non-Functional

1. **NFR1**: Photo recognition accuracy must achieve minimum 85% success rate for clear, well-lit medication label images
2. **NFR2**: OCR processing must complete within 10 seconds for typical smartphone camera images
3. **NFR3**: Smart reminder algorithms must respect user privacy - all learning happens locally without transmitting usage patterns
4. **NFR4**: Progress visualization must load and render within 3 seconds for datasets up to 1 year of medication logs
5. **NFR5**: Export functionality must generate files within 15 seconds for up to 6 months of medication data
6. **NFR6**: The system must maintain offline-first architecture - all Phase 2 features must work without internet connectivity
7. **NFR7**: Photo capture and processing must work across mobile browsers with camera access (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
8. **NFR8**: Smart reminders must not drain device battery - maximum 5% additional battery usage per day
9. **NFR9**: All user medication photos must be processed locally and deleted after information extraction for privacy protection
10. **NFR10**: The system must remain responsive and maintain sub-2-second page load times even with Phase 2 feature additions

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Maintain the clean, non-clinical interface established in MVP while seamlessly integrating intelligent features. Photo capture should feel as natural as taking any smartphone photo, progress visualization should be motivational rather than clinical, and smart reminders should be helpful without being intrusive.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Progressive disclosure**: Advanced features remain hidden until needed, preserving MVP simplicity
- **One-tap workflows**: Critical actions (photo capture, quick logging) accessible in single interactions
- **Visual feedback**: Clear indication of photo processing status, reminder learning progress, and adherence trends

### Core Screens and Views
- Enhanced Add Medication screen with camera integration
- Progress Dashboard with visual charts and streak display
- Smart Reminders Management interface
- Export/Share functionality integrated into existing history views

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Maintain current accessibility standards while ensuring photo capture works with screen readers and voice control.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Continue mobile-first responsive design, optimizing photo capture for smartphone cameras while maintaining desktop functionality.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Continue existing monorepo structure with clear separation between client and server components.

### Service Architecture
Maintain current Node.js/React architecture with added client-side processing capabilities for photo recognition and local ML for smart reminders.

### Testing Requirements
Extend current manual testing to include automated unit tests for photo processing algorithms and smart reminder logic.

### Additional Technical Assumptions
- OCR processing will use client-side JavaScript libraries to maintain offline capability
- Smart reminder ML will use lightweight algorithms suitable for browser environment
- Photo processing will leverage Web APIs for camera access and image manipulation
- Chart visualization will use lightweight charting library compatible with offline-first architecture

## Epic List

**Epic 1: Smart Photo Recognition for Medication Entry**
Enable users to photograph medication labels and automatically extract medication information, reducing manual entry friction while maintaining accuracy through user verification.

**Epic 2: Intelligent Reminder System with Learning**
Implement adaptive reminder system that learns from user behavior patterns to optimize timing and effectiveness of medication reminders.

**Epic 3: Progress Visualization and Motivation**
Provide visual feedback on medication adherence through charts, trends, and gamification elements to encourage consistent usage.

**Epic 4: Export and Healthcare Provider Integration**
Enable users to generate and share medication history reports for healthcare provider communication and record keeping.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
Please create wireframes and user flows for the photo recognition medication entry process, smart reminder interface, and progress visualization dashboard. Focus on maintaining the established non-clinical, approachable design while integrating new intelligent features seamlessly.

### Architect Prompt
Please design the technical architecture for Phase 2 features, focusing on client-side OCR implementation, local machine learning for smart reminders, offline-capable progress visualization, and export functionality. Ensure all features maintain the offline-first architecture and performance standards established in MVP.
